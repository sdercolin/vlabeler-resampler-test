# Resampler Test - vLabeler plugin

This is a batch edit plugin for [vLabeler](https://github.com/sdercolin/vlabeler).
It does similar things as setParam's Synthesis Test (F10), by using the oto parameters for current entry to render and play an audio file.

## Embedded resampler
`worldline` from [OpenUtau](https://github.com/stakira/OpenUtau) is packaged here, and it has been set as the default.
You can use other UTAU synthesis engines as well.

We recommend you to have all your frq files prepared before you start working, as we have found some engines not working well without them, such as `resampler.exe`.


## Download
Please check the latest release and download the binary which is prepared for your OS.

## Installation
