# Resampler Test - vLabeler plugin

This is a batch edit plugin for [vLabeler](https://github.com/sdercolin/vlabeler).
It does similar things as setParam's Synthesis Test (F10), by using the oto parameters for current entry to render and
play an audio file.

## Embedded resampler

`worldline` from [OpenUtau](https://github.com/stakira/OpenUtau) is packaged here, and it has been set as the default.
Please note that you may need to allow the `worldline.exe` or `worldline` binary to run in your OS's security settings.

You can use other UTAU synthesis engines as well, but some of them may not work properly with certain data.

## Download

Please check the latest release and download the binary which is prepared for your OS.

## Installation
